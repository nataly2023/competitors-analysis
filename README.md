The goal of this research is to learn the price changes for each product category among competitors.

All the data stored in dataframe that was generated during data gathering and parsing processes.

    Prices raised in categories:

     amino                    1.9%

     creatine                 0.8%

     gainer-powders           1.1%

     protein-bars             1.5%

     protein-powders          0.5%

     vitamins and minerals    1.4%

    2. The most of competitors stay on the same level of prices in general during research period

   3. Sources with the highest average price:

     source9         206.47

     source11        209.87

     source10        217.75

     client          221.22

    4. Categories with the highest average price:

     protein powders          237.12

     gainer powders           296.42

    5. Source "client" has a highest price in only one category - "gainer powders".

    Also, it has a highest average price for all products together in comparison with others (because of gainer powders).

### 5. Recommendations

    1. Overall, a client can increase the price for all categories by 0.5 percent with no risk, except gainer powders

    2. There is a need to keep tracking price changes and analyse them for more accurate client price changes:

    protein powders, amino, creatine

    3. Client's source is profitable for the customers in categories

    protein-powders, amino, creatine, protein-bars, vitamins and minerals

    because client is out of the top-5 for the price, it's recommended to focus on promotion for products of these categories
